What This Dataset Represents

This is a synthetic environmental dataset created to model how different pollution sources affect lake water quality using Machine Learning.

Each row represents one sampling zone/location in the lake.

1. Pollution Source & Catchment Factors (Input Features)

These variables represent activities around the lake that contribute to pollution:

distance_to_industry_m – How far the zone is from industrial discharge areas (closer = higher industrial pollution risk)

distance_to_sewage_drain_m – Distance from sewage outlets (major source of pharmaceutical contaminants)

population_density_per_km2 – Human activity intensity near the lake

agricultural_runoff_index (0–1) – Fertilizer/soil runoff entering the lake

rainfall_last_7days_mm – Rainfall that washes pollutants into water

temperature_c – Influences chemical reactions in water

2. Water Quality Indicators

These describe the condition of water at each zone:

ph_level – Acidity/alkalinity of water

turbidity_NTU – Suspended particles (microplastics often attach here)

dissolved_oxygen_mgL – Oxygen level (low DO = polluted water)

3. Pollutant Signatures (What we are studying)

microplastic_concentration_ppm – Microplastic pollution level

pharmaceutical_residue_ugL – Medicine/chemical residue from sewage

4. Final Pollution Risk

pollution_risk_index – Overall pollution severity score calculated from all pollutant indicators









“This project is an end-to-end pollution source analysis system built using machine learning.
I collected environmental and human-activity parameters from multiple zones and trained a Random Forest regression model to predict a Pollution Risk Index for each zone.”

“Beyond prediction, the key focus of my project is explainability. I used feature importance and SHAP analysis to clearly identify which factors contribute most to pollution and whether they increase or decrease pollution risk.”

“I also applied unsupervised learning using PCA and K-Means clustering to group zones with similar pollution behavior, which helps in designing area-specific pollution control strategies instead of treating all zones the same.”

“To strengthen the scientific validity, I performed statistical correlation analysis between pollutants and their potential sources and validated significant relationships using p-values.”

“Finally, the system automatically generates interactive visualizations and a detailed HTML/PDF report that summarizes model performance, pollution sources, insights, and actionable recommendations. This makes the project suitable for real-world decision-making and deployment.”

“Overall, the project does not just predict pollution—it explains the causes, groups similar risk zones, and supports evidence-based environmental management.”
